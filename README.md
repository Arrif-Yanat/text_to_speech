1. Project Name
Question: What is the name of your Python project, and what is its main objective?
Answer:
•	Project Name: Text-to-Speech Web Application
•	Main Objective: This project is made to create a simple web app where users can type text, choose a language, and then listen to the text as speech.
2. Type of Data to Store
Question: What types of data will your Python program handle or store?
Answer:
•	The program will handle text input from the user and audio data (MP3 files).
Question: What attributes or fields will each data type include?
Answer:
•	User Input (Text):
o	Text (what the user types)
o	Language (the language chosen for the speech)
•	Audio Data (MP3 files):
o	Filename (the name of the audio file)
o	Language (the language used for the speech)
3. Data Structure
Question: In what format will you store the data within your Python program?
Answer:
•	The text input and language are stored in memory as string values.
•	The audio files (MP3) are saved on the file system in the media/ folder.
Question: What will the structure of your data look like?
Answer:
•	User Input (example):
user_data = {
    'text': "Hello, how are you?",
    'language': 'en'
}
•	Audio Data (stored as files):
The MP3 file is stored in the media/ directory like this:
media/speech.mp3
4. Expected Data Volume
Question: How much data do you expect your Python program to handle?
Answer:
•	The program handles small amounts of data. The text is short (just a few words), and the audio files are small too, around a few megabytes.
5. Data Access Requirements
Question: How do you plan to access and manipulate the data in your Python program?
Answer:
•	The program will get text from a web form (POST request) and save the audio file on the server.
•	There's no need for complicated data queries or handling.
Question: Do you need specific data access features like search functions, filters, or data aggregation?
Answer:
•	No, the app only needs to convert text to speech, so there are no advanced search or data aggregation features.
6. Security Considerations
Question: Are there any security requirements for the data in your Python project?
Answer:
•	Since the app only takes text input and generates audio, we need to make sure the text is safe (no harmful code or scripts).
Question: How will you manage user authentication, data privacy, and permissions within the program?
Answer:
•	There’s no user login or private data involved. The only thing we need to manage is allowing users to access their audio file.
7. Scalability and Flexibility
Question: How do you expect your Python program to scale if data volume or users increase?
Answer:
•	If more users use the app, we may need to add more storage for audio files. We could also use cloud services for handling larger amounts of data.
Question: Do you anticipate the need to modify or expand the system’s features in the future?
Answer:
•	Yes, we may add more languages, allow for longer text inputs, or let users save their past audio files.
8. Technology and Tools
Question: What Python libraries, frameworks, or tools will you use to develop this project?
Answer:
•	Django: Web framework for building the app.
•	gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech): Library to turn text into speech.
•	os: For handling files on the computer.
•	settings.py (Django): To manage where files are saved.
Question: Are there any additional technologies or integrations required?
Answer:
•	No, there are no extra technologies needed for this project, but we might use cloud storage if the app grows.
